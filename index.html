            <p>Hello, I am a student at The Coding Bootcamp at The University of North Carolina Charlotte studying full
                stack web development. I have a Bachelor of the Arts degree in Philosophy that I received from
                Appalachian State University, though I have always had an interest in coding and have decided to focus
                my career trajectory thusly. I have been married to my wife, Madalyn, for three years - though we have
                been together for nearly 17! I am the proud father of three kitty children - 12, 11 and 10 years old -
                and we hope to someday add a dog to our family when space permits it. I am looking forward to the rest
                of my coding journey.</p>
